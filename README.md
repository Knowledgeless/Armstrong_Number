# Armstrong_Number

<br>
<p>
  Armstrong Number is a number where the sumation of the cube of all digits is equal to the actual number. I know that my "English" is bad enough. So, Lets see an example:<br><br>
  Suppose 153 is a number. Now we have to check that is this number an armstrong number or not!<br>
  153 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup>  <br>
      = 1 + 125 + 27 <br>
      = 153 <br>
<b>Yes, 153 is an armstrong number.</b> <br>
</p>
<p>
  In case you may want a list of armstrong number in a range. Thats why in my code I kept both of the oppurtunaty. To run this script.
  <ul>
    <li>Download the script. "https://github.com/Knowledgeless/Armstrong_Number.git"</li>
    <li>Run 'python3 armstrong_number.py'</li>
    <li>Choose an option.</li>
    <li>Enter what ever script is asking to.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
